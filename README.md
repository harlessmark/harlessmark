## Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark

I'm a frontend web developer with an affinity to web usability and design.

### Projects

#### [Hollywood Hangman](https://hollywoodhangman.com) [[repo](https://github.com/harlessmark/hollywood-hangman)]
A guessing game for movie buffs. Created using a Python script to scrape IMDb's top 1,000 rated movies, Redux for complex state management, and styled-components. How many movies can you guess correctly?

#### [Ninny Code!](https://ninnycode.com) [[repo](https://github.com/harlessmark/ninnycode)]
Easily remember and share your Nintendo Switch Friend Code. Built with React, Python Flask for HTTP requests and validation, and PostgreSQL user data storage.

#### [totally-random](https://ninnycode.com) [[repo](https://github.com/harlessmark/totally-random)]
A small JavaScript utility library for easier number randomization. Shuffle an array, get a random number between two numbers, "rig" certain items to increase or decrease probabilities, and more!

#### [Pronounly](https://pronounly.netlify.app) [[repo](https://github.com/harlessmark/pronounly)]
Pronounly helps you share your gender pronoun with other people by pasting a link in your bio.
